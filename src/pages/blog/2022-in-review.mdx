2022 was a huge year for me both personally and professionally. Like last year I wanted to write a blog post about my thoughts on the year, reivew my goals from last year, and plan my goals for 2023.

## 2022's goals
- ✅ Read ten books - According to my [StoryGraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/), I ended up reading twelve books this year.
- ❌ Earn at least one dollar online - This one did not happen this year. I did some freelance work, but the goal I had in mind for self was more akin to building a product or publishing a game on steam. 
- ✅ Climb a v7 - I ended up climbing the first climb marked v7 in early summer (May IIRC), although it was kind of soft. The first v7 I climbed that I felt was up to the grade, was shortly after in June. 
- ❌ Write six blog posts - This one did not happen, although I have a pretty nice back log of half written posts.
- ✅ Drop at least three Google products - This was probably my most successful goal. I was able to drop Andriod, GMail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. The only google service I am still using is Google Photos.
- ❌ Meditate every day for 5 minutes - This also did not happen...like at all.
- ✅ Plan and stick to a personal budget - This _was_ a huge success. Despite some pretty big expenses, I was able to be much more mindful of my finances and keep better track of them.
- ❌ Complete 180 [Pixel Dailies](https://twitter.com/Pixel_Dailies) - I did twelve...

Not super happy with 50%, but I am super happy with what I was able to acomplish this year. ## Recap of the Last year
Since it seems like every service under the sun is doing "Wraps" or "Recaps", I thought I'd would add a few to this post.

## 2022 Recap

<ImageSlider client:load images={[steamImg, twitchImg, spotifyImg]} />

Outside of those a ton of stuff happened this year. To start off the year I took an incredible trip to Smith Rock in Oregon, where a friend and I got to multipitch for the very fist time. Which was an absolutely incredible experience, and one that I've thought about a ton since. Shortly after that, my wife and I moved to Austin from Houston. Living in Austin has been an incredible change of pace, espcially due to the fact that outdoor rockclimbing has become _much_ more accessible. Since the weather has cooled down we have been able to go out climb outside almost every weekend. 

After the move in late March, not too much happened until the summer, where I picked up my [job search again](/blog/thoughts-on-recent-job-search). In early June we got a new dog named Roxy. For many reasons Roxy will go on to be the single biggest source of stress and joy I will experience for the rest of the year.

Honestly after this point the rest of the year flew by incredibly quickly. I started my new job on the first day of August, and have been loving it. The my co-workers and manager are both _amazing_. The work is interesting, and I have the oppurtunity to learn a lot. I got into a groove working -> climbing -> working with the dogs -> playing games. August to November abnsoloutly sped past me. It wasn't until the holidays things started to slow down a bit.


## Top Games of 2022

As you saw in the Recap section, I play a lot of games. I thought I'd be fun this year to add a Top 5 list of my favorite games that were released or I played for the first time this year.

1. [Elden Ring](https://www.igdb.com/games/elden-ring)
2. [God of War Ragnarok](https://www.igdb.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok)
3. [Crystal Project](https://www.igdb.com/games/crystal-project)
4. [Rimworld Biotech DLC](https://www.igdb.com/games/rimworld-biotech)
5. [Vampire Survivors](https://www.igdb.com/games/vampire-survivors) (?)


## My Goals for 2023

- __Climb a v8__ - This one should be doable as I have gotten more consistent with the v7's at my local gym. If I continue training and climbing as much as I have this should be a doable goal. 
- __Release a game on Steam__ - Similar to the "Make at least $1 online" from 2022, but this time its more focused on just getting a game onto Steam. I don't really care if anyone buys it, but I would like to learn more about the process _and_ actually finish a game project.
- __Drop Google Photos + Google Drive__ - I have a lot of my life backed up on these two cloud products from Google. I would really like to untether myself from Google completly, and finding a solution that works 50% as seamlessly as these two do for my use cases would be amazing. 
- __Write AND publish six blog posts__ - Again, similar to the goal from last year, but this time I'm not going to try to force myself to adhere to a schedule. Instead I'm going to just focus on writing about things I care about, in the hope of eventually getting something out there.
