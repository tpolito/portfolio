Okay...so I remade my blog again. For better or worse, I have probably spent more time making and remaking this blog then I have actually writing for it. That being said I did it again. This time using [Astro](https://astro.build/). I thought it would be fun to write this post going through the history of the blog, and updating it each time I inevitibly remake it.

### The first try

The first "personal" website/blog I made for myself was in early 2017. It was make using `create-react-app`, and used _way_ to many css animations. I think that may have lasted the longest, according to Github I didn't remake my site again until late 2019. It had an incredibly convoluted system for loading texts and posts. I ended up writing one post and never touching it again.

### The CMS era

I stumbled upon a cool little headless cms called [Strapi](https://strapi.io/). Determined to make a blog using it I dove in head first, bought a digital ocean droplet to host it and then built a small frontend using Next.js. In my opinion this site also used _way_ to many css animations/transitons. But overall I was happy with the site. It was easy to use, maintain, and I was able to get some very small amount of dev ops experience deploying the droplet. I was able to create posts inside the CMS, and it was an pretty smooth experience.

Before my next stint with a CMS I had a quick affair [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which I _did not enjoy_ for a few reasons. But needless to say I didn't endup staying with it too long.

Next up was [Dato CMS](https://www.datocms.com/)
