Out of all the games I've played this year [I AM YOUR BEAST](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/) by developer [Strange Scaffold]() is the game I'm thinking about the most. Despite playing it right off the heels of [Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/), which rightfully has a shot at being the game of year, [I AM YOUR BEAST](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/) has stuck with me more so. Not only from a story standpoint, but from a game design stand point as well.

## Hotline Miami

I'm goint to segway for am moment here to talk about why [Hotline Miami]() (both one and two) is such a fun time. It blends action, story, and problem solving in an incredibly unique way. Each mission sees the player setting out to complete some objective, which involves going room to room, floor to floor, dispatching bad guys. Which makes it sound like a stock-standard action game. However, by limiting your hit points, and setting a consistent set of rules which is built upon throughout the game, Hotline Miami turns into almost more a puzzle game. Replaying each level to up your score, dispatch the enemies faster and more efficiently. You spend time optimizing the route through each floor in such a way that the action almost takes a backseat. I'm unware of a game that captured that same magic. There are many 2D top down shooters, but in my gaming career only [Hotline Miami]() managed to capture that magic
