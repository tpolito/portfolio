2024 has come and gone. As is tradition I want to use this post to go over the year, my goals, what I did, and some of my favorite things. 

## Goals from last year

The last three years ([2021](./2021-in-review.md), [2022](./2022-in-review.md), and [2023](./2023-in-review.md)) I've set goals for myself going forward.

### Goals from 2024

- ‚ùå **Climb a v8**
- ‚ùå **Climb a 5.12c**
- ‚ùå **Publish more of my writing** 
- ‚ùå **Finish creating _A_ game** 
- ‚úÖ **Travel more** 

Soooo...this wasn't the best year for goals and I think it marks a turning point for how I want to continue setting goals for my self going foward. Every year will have reasons for _why_ I didn't finish something. This year happened to be a year of a massive work project spanning April - August that took up so much of time, really draining me in the process, and leaving me wanting more relaxing things after work. Thankfully it turned out well, and the people I work with are increidble humans making it worth it in the end. 

That being said barely hitting one goal doesn't feel good. You can't predict what a year will bring. What events will derail plans or what new interests/passions will spawn new goals all together. So this year I'm going to try setting "intentions", these will have soft goals associated with them. But I'm going to measure them differently. Before that though, I want to take a look at the year. Go through some of the highlights and talk about some of my favorite things.

## A review of 2024

The first big event of 2024 was a trip to go on the [Germany, Italy & Switzerland](https://www.efultimatebreak.com/trips/germany-italy-switzerland) tour via [EF Ultimate Break](https://www.efultimatebreak.com) (I'm not sure anyone actually reads this but if you stumble upon this I work at Education First, on these products). This was an absolute blast of a time, it was so illuminating and inspring to meet the people who travel through Ultimate Break. My family was fortuneate enough, that I did a lot of traveling growing up. A trip to Europe is not an intimidating endevour for me. That being said, growing up with travel is a luxury not everyone has. Getting to see firsthand how a product line mine gives people the confidenec to travel was genuily very inspiring, and incredibly motivating. This was one of my favorite photos from the trip, a top a mountain in Lucerine.

Next up was a trip to east coast in April. It started as a work trip to Boston with the fun twist that my return flight was going to Montreal instead üá®üá¶. After spending a few days in Montreal, seeing the sights, eating the poutine, and meeting some internet friends for the first time. I booked a flight to Washington D.C for yet another internet friend meetup. In total I was gone 13 days deboping around the east coast and having a blast. Favorite picture from this trip was coworking on a rooftop along side my friends beardie.

Now we enter the part of the year where that big work project really kicks into high gear. Working long hours, the whole team sprinting headlong toward a launch that is slated for _sometime_ during the summer. I'm honestly to thankful for the people I work with, despite the long hours, and weekends everyone continued to keep their spirits high and bulid each other up. That didn't really make the time alterting effects stop, but we made it. Some highlights from the months of March -> August include 7 miles north in Austin. Putting me walking distance from a climbing gym and the train station (it doesn't go very many places but its cool). I think the Elden Ring DLC wa released sometime during this and was absolutely incredibe. But other than that, these months were a lot of work. I didn't fully settle in to my new place until well into August. Favortie picture from this time period was Evee in a coffee shop at 3:30am on one of the last nights of on-call work.

The last half of the year involved lots of PTO where I mostly just stayed a home recuperating, not coding, and getting back into my various hobbies. While writing I can think of three things I'd want to remember in the future and will be relevant further down. The first is that September after years of resistance, joking with friends that I "didn't need to stretch", and generally ignoring all fitness but climbing I finally starting going to a yoga class regularly. What a humbling, illuminating, and motivating experience. I was extrodinarily lucky to find a instructor that I love, that teaches a class I adore, and is great at making sure everyone has something to do and work towards. The second was a trip back to Montreal! This time for a work Q1 kick off, a few coworkers and I got there early. It was honestly such a blast seeing everyone, made me thankful all over again for the awesome people I work with. Lastly was a giant friends-giving party in Flordia. My self and 10 of my closest friends decended upon the beachs of Flordia for a week of hanging out and good vibes. Favorite picture from this time period was the top of a hike in Montreal.

For my money, those are the big highlights of the year that feel comfortable posting about online.

## üèÜ Favorite things of 2024 

This is in no particular order, just a bunch of stuff I really liked this year. 

- [Cotopaxi travel backpack](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/allpa-35l-travel-pack-4?variant=41821089267773) - Not a lot to say, a very well designed and durable backpack. It went with me on almost all my trips with me.
- [Elden Ring Shadow or the Erdtree](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/) - Incredible in every sense of the word. Challenging, fun, cathartic, and overall just an amazing experience.
- [I AM YOUR BEAST](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/) - [See this post](./i-am-your-beast) for more thoughts.
- [Wind and Truth](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/298bac36-8787-4367-bbdb-ffccff72011a) - The first arc of Stormlight archieve done. What a ride, overall I really enjoyed the book as a longtime Cosmere fan. But this was the book that had the lowest lows out of the 5 books for me personally. I'm writing a post on my thoughts which will be linked here evetually.

In additon here are a few "recap" images from this year.

### ‚ú® Intentions ‚ú® for 2025

As mentioned above I'd like to focus on a few themes or intentions that build to a specific end. I think focusing more broadly on intentions will take some of the pressure off and allow me to measure success based on progress, while allowing me to still work towards things.

- **Focus on my body** - This involves two parts. Continue going to yoga/stretching, and train climbing. The two underlying goals are touching my toes and climbing a higher grade than I did this year.
- **Create things I like** - The two parts of this are to grind game development. I'm making one game a month alongside some friends to improve at this. The other part is to continue writing. I have half a dozen half written posts I'd like to finish writing and release.
