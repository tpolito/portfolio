2023 was _a year_. This has been by far the most emotionally exhuasting year I've had to date. With that being said, I don't think recounting that online would be all that productive. So this year I'm going to focus on my favorite things from 2023 and my goals going foward.

## Goals from last year

The last two years ([2021](./2021-in-review.md), [2022](./2022-in-review.md)) I've set goals for my self going forward.

## Goals for 2023

- ‚ùå **Climb a v8** - This one is a bummer. Over the last year I made a ton of progress towards a v8. Far more consistent v7's, and a long stint training. Buuut, come September I somewhat seriously injuried the A2 pully in hand. Which set me on a long rehab path that as of Dec 28th will be done! During rehab I got into sport climbing, which has been one of the highpoints of the year.
- ‚ùå **Release a game on Steam** - More game dev than ever before, but non even close to done. Just a ton of protyping. Perhaps I will post some of the unfinished projects on here.
- ‚úÖ **Drop Google Photos + Google Drive** - This one was easy. Shoutouts to [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/), made it super easy to drop both. With that I am completly de-googled. Mail + Calendar are with [ProtonMail](TODO_LINK_TO_PROTON), and Photos and Files with [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/).
- ‚ùå **Write AND publish six blog posts** - I did technically write six posts, but wasn't happy with them. If this post ends up going out this year I'll be at four. That being said I did drastically increase my writing this year. Hopefully in 2024 I can convince my self to post more of it.
- ‚úÖ **Stretch more** - Anything is better than zero right? Jokes aside I did stretch more and attend a handful of yoga classes. I hope to increase this and do much more of it in the new year.

Not super thrilled with this year, but given the year I suppose I can't be too mad ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## 2023 Recap

This year feels somehow like it went on forever. But high level, rapid fire recap before getting into my favorite _things_ of the year. Moved walking distance to a climbing gym, by this point read 12 3/4 books, got into and fell out of painting Warhammer models, went back to Alaska for my brother's wedding, went to Panama for a work trip and discovered Central America is really dope, got into sport climbing, and took a trad climbing class.

So much happened but off the top of my head those are some of the stand outs. I also have some of those "end of year" wrap up images similar to what I shared last year.

## üìö Books

I read a lot of books year. I caught up with the cosmere completly, which gave me ample time to explore a bit. Some standouts in no particular order

- **Blacktonge Theif** -
- **Kings of the Wyld** -
- **Sunlit Man** -
- **Tress of the Emerald Sea** -

## üéÆ Games

2023 really was a standout year for games. A ton of incredible games were released this year, and so many were right up my ally. These are my favorites (in order this time).

1. **Baldur's Gate 3** -
2. **Justant** -
3. **Lies of P** -
4. **Dredge** -
5. **Darkest Dungeon 2**
6. **Warhammer 40k Boltgun** -
7. **Remnant 2** -

## üì∫ TV Show's & Movies

I'll be the first to admit I don't really watch all that much in the world of tv and movies, but I did have some things this year that I really enjoyed. List in no particular order.

- **Dropout TV Programming** -
- **Critical Role Campaign 3** -
- **Jujutsu Kaisen - Shibuya** -
- **Klaus** -
- **John Wick 4** -

## üèÜ Goals for 2024

- **Climb a v8 5.12c** - Now that my tendon is back to normal I'm very confident I can get a v8 this year.
- **Climb a 5.12c** - Since I've gotten into sport climbing I've tacked on a 5.12c to this as well. Which I'd like to do clean.
- **Publish more of my writing** - This is something I struggled with last year, I wrote a lot of things that I just didn't post. This upcoming year I would like to get more stuff posted.
