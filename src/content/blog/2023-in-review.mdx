2023 was _a year_. This has been by far the most emotionally exhausting year I've had to date. With that being said, I don't think recounting that online would be all that productive. So this year I'm going to focus on my favorite things from 2023 and my goals going forward.

## Goals from last year

The last two years ([2021](./2021-in-review.md), [2022](./2022-in-review.md)) I've set goals for myself going forward.

### Goals for 2023

- ‚ùå **Climb a v8** - This one is a bummer. Over the last year, I made a ton of progress towards a v8. Far more consistent v7's, and a long stint of training. But, come September I somewhat seriously injured the A2 pully in hand. This set me on a long rehab path that as of Dec 28th will be done! During rehab, I got into sport climbing, which has been one of the high points of the year.
- ‚ùå **Release a game on Steam** - More game dev than ever before, but non even close to done. Just a ton of prototyping. Perhaps I will post some of the unfinished projects here.
- ‚úÖ **Drop Google Photos + Google Drive** - This one was easy. Shoutouts to [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/), made it super easy to drop both. With that, I am completely de-googled. Mail + Calendar are with [ProtonMail](TODO_LINK_TO_PROTON), and Photos and Files with [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/).
- ‚ùå **Write AND publish six blog posts** - I did technically write six posts but wasn't happy with them. If this post ends up going out this year I'll be at four. That being said I did drastically increase my writing this year. Hopefully, in 2024 I can convince myself to post more of it.
- ‚úÖ **Stretch more** - Anything is better than zero right? Jokes aside I did stretch more and attend a handful of yoga classes. I hope to increase this and do much more of it in the new year.

Not super thrilled with this year, but given the year I suppose I can't be too mad ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I'll now list some of my favorite things of the year.

## üìö Books

I read a lot of books this year. I caught up with the Cosmere completely, which gave me ample time to explore a bit. Some standouts in no particular order

- **Blacktonge Theif** - This book stands apart from the others. The witty prose, and charm woven within the dramatic narrative are exceptional. The world-building leaves me itching for more, so much is held close to the chest that it allows the imagination to run wild.
- **Kings of the Wyld** - A heartfelt tale of what it means to be friends. Despite the comical, tropey setting, it delivers a heartwarming and action-packed novel. See more thoughts [here](./kings-of-the-wyld.md)
- **Sunlit Man** - A love letter to Cosmere fans. A book written by Sanderson to reward those people who invested the time to read it all. Fan service in the best way, a story you could appreciate on its own, but will have a much deeper meaning if it's the _last_ Cosmere book you read.

## üéÆ Games

2023 was a standout year for games. A ton of incredible games were released this year, and so many were right up my alley. These are my favorites (in order this time).

1. **Baldur's Gate 3** - The _BEST_ game I've ever played hands down. The attention to detail, writing, customization, and freedom this game gives you are unparalleled.
2. **Lies of P** - Honestly if you had told me a non-Fromsoft souls like would be _this_ good before playing this I would have laughed. Superb combat, blending the best elements of Bloodborne and Sekiro. Amazing boss battles, and a story that doesn't require endless item reading and YouTube videos to follow.
3. **Darkest Dungeon 2** - A great sequel to the oringnal. Keep me coming back for more, and more.
4. **Warhammer 40k Boltgun** - An amazing, low stakes boomer-shooter. Love the small bits of love it shows to the franchise while keeping the game light and fast-paced.

## ‚ú® Misc

A collection of technology, videos, or other random things I found I loved throughout the year.

- **[Kagi](https://kagi.com/)** - A paid, privacy first search engine. I know...why would you _pay_ for a search? Google is free! However, the quality of the results is drastically improved compared to Google. By far the most impactful thing I purchased last year.
- **[Lies of P OST](https://open.spotify.com/album/5gJEFiXI4rIXC2TWIx65ZQ?si=MTrte0yZTCuebI6OQepajA)** - This OST has some incredible music, both moving and intense. Listened to it _A LOT_ last year.
- **[Marine Layer backpack](https://www.marinelayer.com/products/roll-top-backpack-in-phantom?_pos=1&_sid=94e4342e1&_ss=r)** - I'm not going to claim it the best backpack in the world, and it's sold by a clothing company. _But_ the design is simple and just makes sense. I've been beyond happy. It went with me everywhere the last 8 months of the year and has shown no sign of wear.

## üèÜ Goals for 2024

- **Climb a v8** - Now that my tendon is back to normal I'm very confident I can get a v8 this year.
- **Climb a 5.12c** - Since I've gotten into sport climbing I've tacked on a 5.12c to this as well. Which I'd like to do clean.
- **Publish more of my writing** - This is something I struggled with last year, I wrote a lot of things that I just didn't post. This upcoming year I would like to get more stuff posted.
- **Finish creating _A_ game** - So many prototypes, jam games, etc. This year I want a game that I can call _DONE_. Doesn't need to make it to Steam, Itch would be fine. But I want to push through the boring parts and have a game that I can call complete.
- **Travel more** -
