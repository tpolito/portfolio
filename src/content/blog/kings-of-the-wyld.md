In 2017/2018 Nicholas Eames two books in his first series "The Band". Both of these books stuck with me more so than most other books I read this year and I wanted to take the time to write about them. This post will contain minor spoilers for both books.

## Kings of the Wyld

In this first book we follow Clay Cooper, an older man whom is presumably part of the "town guard", which is implied to be a pretty ragtag group of vollenteers that defends his little town. While we learn later just how formitable a warrior/fighter Clay is, he is just a run of the mill grunt in this system. Clay has a wife and child, whom he cares for dearly and it is told to use very early on that Clay was once a part of a mercenary band called _Saga_.

Its here on his walk home we meet the second member of _Saga_, and its "leader" Gabe. Gabe is clearly down on his luck, he recants to Clay that he is now divorced, and his daughter has run off to a far away city besiged by monsters seeking greatness. Gabe come seeking to get Clay, and the rest of the old band, back together so they can cross the world to save his daughter Rose. Clay initially says no but relents after his daughter asked "would you come save me". That is the setup, shortly there after we begin traveling and meet the remaining members of _Saga_ in the form of the exentric wizard Mogg, the once deadly rouge now fat king Matrick, and (after some hardship) Ganelon who for reasons hasn't aged at all.

The formly legendary group set off and their adventures as we the readers follow them on this journey through thick and thin. While I found the pacing to be a bit odd, and I eventually came to terms with the fact that all of our characters were essentailly the equivalent of high level DnD protaganists. But the parts of this book that stick with me are the way Eames writes friendships. He captures what it is like to have friends close enough that you would consider family so perfectly. The dialog does such an incredible job of conveying the experience this group has and the depth of knowledge they still have about each other even though all this time has passed.
