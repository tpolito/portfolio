In 2017/2018 Nicholas Eames two books in his first series "The Band". Both of these books stuck with me more so than most other books I read this year and I wanted to take the time to write about them. This post will contain minor spoilers for both books.

## Kings of the Wyld

In this first book we follow Clay Cooper, an older man whom is presumably part of the "town guard", which is implied to be a pretty ragtag group of vollenteers that defends his little town. While we learn later just how formitable a warrior/fighter Clay is, he is just a run of the mill grunt in this system. Clay has a wife and child, whom he cares for dearly and it is told to use very early on that Clay was once a part of a mercenary band called _Saga_.

Its here on his walk home we meet the second member of _Saga_, and its "leader" Gabe. Gabe is clearly down on his luck, he recants to Clay that he is now divorced, and his daughter (Rose, its important later) has run off to a far away city besiged by monsters seeking greatness. Gabe come seeking to get Clay, and the rest of the old band, back together so they can cross the world to save his daughter Rose. Clay initially says no but relents after his daughter asked "would you come save me". That is the setup, shortly there after we begin traveling and meet the remaining members of _Saga_ in the form of the exentric wizard Mogg, the once deadly rouge now fat king Matrick, and (after some hardship) Ganelon who for reasons hasn't aged at all.

The formly legendary group set off and their adventures as we the readers follow them on this journey through thick and thin. While I found the pacing to be a bit odd, and I eventually came to terms with the fact that all of our characters were essentailly the equivalent of high level DnD protaganists. But the parts of this book that stick with me are the way Eames writes friendships. He captures the feeling of having friends that feel closer than family. The little moments in this book are my absolute favorite for that reason. When the spectacle subsides, and we can see how deeply these characters care for eachother.

I've found that for me personally, its hard to sell me on these kinds of bonds in fiction. One of the only other examples I can think of Wax and Wayne from [Mistborn Era 2](https://app.thestorygraph.com/series/2). But its exactly these kind of realtionships that make a story stand out to me, and make it feel more real. Eames acomplishes this in a number of ways, but mainly through the characters _actions_. These are gruff, grizzled, battle hardened warriors. Outside of some of Clays inner monoglue we get very few moments of outward expression. It is through seeing the little actions they all do for eachother, and some exchanges that hint at an incredibly depth of knowledge regarding eachother that we really understand.

## Bloody Rose

In the second book Eames swtiches it up on us a bit. We follow Tam Hashford, a young girl from a small town. With dreams of adventuring. Do to circumstances, Tam ends up joining the mercenary band "Bloodly Rose" (yes that Rose). Eames uses this to show us deep friendship from an outsiders point of view. We have all the same questions as Tam, regarding the groups dynamic. It should also be noted that this is a more "modern"(?) friendship. The band is much more open about their feelings and emotionally available, unlike _Saga_ in the first book who showed this mainly through actions. We are shown this through both action and words. The group bickers, crys, laughs, and is put through the ringer together.

Again Eames is able to portray this group of friends in a way that feels exceptionally real, and authentic. The characters do stupid and dangerous things for their friends. Confide in one another about their fears and dreams. The bueaty of this is we see it all unfold from Tam's point of view. Were discovering how much these characters care for eachother at the same time as Tam is, and in addtion the entire time Tam is slowly being integrated into the group as well. The moments of vulnerablity in this story stand out to me, and its shown that even the larger than life individuals that Tam has joined up with are still people at their core.

## Closing thoughts

The reason these books, despite some of their flaws, have had such a grip on me this year is due to how _real_ these bonds feel. I was able to connect to the characters more deeply than other, probably more "realized", characters because of the way Eames portrayed their friendship. In two distinct ways Eames shows us how capable he is of this type of character work. It is for this reason that I am so highly anticipating the third entry in "The Band" (Just please don't pull a Rothfuss one me ðŸ¤ž).
